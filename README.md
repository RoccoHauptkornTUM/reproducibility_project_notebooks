## Thesis Abstract

Reproducibility is fundamental in scientific computing, ensuring that computational and experimental results can be replicated independently of time, system, and user. This thesis compares two reproducibility platforms â€“ Binder and CodeOcean â€“ based on usability, performance, limitations, and suitability for different application areas. The study focuses on three domains: Business Analytics, Machine Learning and Scientific Computing. The thesis will implement standardized "Hello World" test programs tailored to each domain to systematically assess these platforms. These programs will be deployed and executed on all platforms to analyze reproducibility challenges, including dependency management, execution consistency, and ease of use. The final results will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different reproducibility solutions and recommend the right platform based on specific research and industry needs.

## How to Run the Notebooks

### Option 1: Launch Online with Binder
Click below to open the notebooks in a temporary, cloud-based environment:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RoccoHauptkornTUM/reproducibility_project_notebooks/HEAD)

### Option 2: Run on CodeOcean

To run the project on [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/dashboard):

1. **Create a free account** at [https://codeocean.com](https://codeocean.com/login)
2. **Click "Create New Compute Capsule"**
3. Choose:
   - **"Copy from public Git"**
   - Paste the repo URL:  
     ```
     https://github.com/RoccoHauptkornTUM/reproducibility_project_notebooks.git
     ```

4. After importing:
   - Select either the **JupyterLab** or **VSCode** interface
   - Go to the **Environment** tab:
     - Manually add dependencies based on `requirements.txt`
     - Or use the **postInstall** script to auto-install:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

5. Once the environment is ready:
   - Launch the capsule

### Option 3: Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RoccoHauptkornTUM/reproducibility_project_notebooks.git
   cd reproducibility_project_notebooks
2. **Create a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
